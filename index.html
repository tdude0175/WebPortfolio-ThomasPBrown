    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>
        I have lived in Memphis, TN most of my life. I have been into video games from a young age and seek to pursue a career in game development.
        After graduating from high-school, I continued my education at Southwest TN Community College Studying General Studies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I took a break from college after a semester to try and learn a family trade with my family owned business.
        After spending some time in the workforce I became an apprentice at Code Crew. This experience reignited my love for coding. I am now looking to start a promising career in software development.
